OntoDIVE - An ontology for representing data science initiatives upon big data

Companies are leveraging data science upon big data initiatives intending to be more and more data-driven.
However, to reach a better cost-benefit, it is important for companies to understand all aspects involved in such initiatives.

Main goal of OntoDIVE is to accurately describe data science upon big data. The ontology explains interactions between people, 
processes and technologies in a data science initiative upon big data.

To build OntoDIVE, we followed Knowledge Meta Processes guidelines from Ontology Engineering Methodology, which consists of 
five main steps: a) Feasibility Study, b) Kickoff, c) Refinement, d) Evaluation and e) Application and Evolution

Software Protégé Desktop version 5.5.0 was used to build OntoDIVE as a representational instrument. 
DL Query plugin was installed on top of Protégé to validate final ontology.

OntoDIVE is directed to the following end users
a) CUSTOMERS - organizations from any economic activity who want to run data science initiatives upon big data technologies in their own operations.
b) CONSULTANTS - people or group of people who want to provide consultancy services for data science initiatives upon big data technologies
c) TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPERS - people or group of people who develop big data technologies and want to analyze how their products fit in real-world data science initiatives
d) STANDARDS PUBLISHERS - people or group of people who develop data science processes and want to analyze usage of their processes
e) RESEARCHERS - people or group of people who want to perform comprehensive analyses of data science initiatives upon big data technologies for academic purposes

OntoDIVE should be considered as an initial version. Although it was validated by description logics queries it has never been applied into a productive system.
